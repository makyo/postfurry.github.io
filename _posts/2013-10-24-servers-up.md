We're up and running at our new home.  The server is muck.postfurry.net.  For regular connections, the port is now 4444, and, for those muck clients that support it, you can connect using SSL/TLS on port 5555.

Please let me know if you have any issues, feel free to leave a comment here about it if you can't contact me some other way.
